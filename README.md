# Task Horizon

A task manager plugin for SiYuan. It aggregates tasks from multiple documents into a single view with rules (filters), grouping, sorting, and a quick editor (quickbar).

## Usage
1. Enable the plugin in SiYuan and refresh the app once.
2. Open the manager:
   - Desktop: click the top bar icon added by the plugin (it opens a Task Horizon tab).
   - Mobile: use the breadcrumb bar button:
     - short press: Quick Add
     - long press: open the manager

## Configure
1. Open `⚙️ Settings` from the toolbar.
2. Add at least one document in **Document Groups & Documents** (otherwise the manager has nothing to load).
3. Optionally configure:
   - Rules (filters)
   - Columns (visibility/order/width)
   - Custom status options
   - Quickbar (enable/disable, pin new tasks by default)
   - Optional tomato.js integration (timer/reminders/spent column)
